==Speciality breads, half-time recipes, give strawberries a little loving.==

#So. The World Cup is finally upon us, and of course we had to share Delia’s recipes you can rustle up during half-time, or - in case of those who hate football – we have two great recipes you can rustle up in 15 minutes! This week the Delia Online Cookery School with Waitrose lesson covers speciality breads - did you know how easy it is to make focaccia?

The strawberry season is well and truly here, like little ruby red harbingers of summer and all the other soft fruits that will follow shortly, have a look at our fabulous collection of Delia’s strawberry recipes.  If you view Delia Online on a mobile or hand-held device, please take our survey, enter our great competitions including the chance to see Maureen Lipman in Daytona, and see what our new Cake of the Week is.#

"This week our Bread for Beginners lesson covers speciality bread, and do we have a little gem to show you.  Pinzini is an Italian bread, each little triangle is quickly fried, sprinkled with salt and traditionally served with cold meats.  If you are aiming to eat outside this weekend, a lunch of antipasti served with pinzini will be a real winner.  Watch how to make them, plus Focaccia and Potato Bread with Goats' Cheese and Thyme by clicking below."

"For some, the next four weeks will be heaven, glued to the telly watching the World Cup. For others it will be hell, hearing nothing but the blooming World Cup (and it will seem much, much longer than four weeks!).   We have two great recipes that can be prepared and then cooked during half-time, so you won’t miss a minute of the action, and if you hate football, you can always keep the recipes up your sleeve for when you need to make something really quick."

-Just add cream-

"Our Cake of The Week is Spiced Apple and Cider Cake from the book Delia’s Cakes.  The combination of spices, the hint of orange and the tartness of apples are all perfectly balanced.  It can easily be made in advance so is a great choice as a dessert, and with only needing some crème fraîche or whipped cream to serve it makes entertaining hassle free."
